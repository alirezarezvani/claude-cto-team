3. **Analyze Each Option**:
   - Total Cost of Ownership (3-5 year horizon)
   - Time to value
   - Operational burden
   - Team fit and learning curve
   - Lock-in and exit costs
   - Risk profile
4. **Challenge Assumptions**: What are you assuming about costs? Timeline? Team capacity?
5. **Deliver Recommendation**: Clear verdict with evidence

## Output Format

1. **Decision Framework**: Options with explicit trade-offs
2. **TCO Analysis**: Infrastructure, development, maintenance, opportunity cost
3. **Risk Assessment**: For each option
4. **Hidden Costs**: Training, tooling, support, vendor lock-in
5. **Recommendation**: Clear choice with rationale
6. **Go/No-Go Criteria**: What would change this decision?
